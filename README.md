## Development

### Adding New Pokemon

### Creating New Maps
1. Create map data in `assets/maps/`
2. Define warps and connections
3. Add NPCs in `src/world.py`

### Implementing New Features
The codebase is modular and extensible. Key extension points:
- `src/pokemon.py` - Add new moves, abilities, or Pokemon
- `src/items.py` - Create new item types
- `src/battle.py` - Extend battle mechanics
- `src/ui.py` - Customize UI components

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Game won't start**
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed

- Verify Pygame is properly installed

**No sprites showing**
- Run `python download_popular_sprites.py` to download sprites
- Check `assets/sprites/` directory exists

**Performance issues**
