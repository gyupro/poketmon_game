## Getting Started

### Finding Wild Pokemon
- **You start in Pallet Town** - There are NO wild Pokemon in towns!
- **Go NORTH to Route 1** to find wild Pokemon

### Tips
- Different routes have different Pokemon

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find any Pokemon!"
1. Make sure you're NOT in a town (Pallet Town, Viridian City, etc.)
2. Go to a ROUTE (Route 1 is north of Pallet Town)
3. Walk in TALL GRASS tiles
4. Keep walking - encounters are random (12-20% chance per step)
