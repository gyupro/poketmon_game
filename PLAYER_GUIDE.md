# Pokemon Game - Player Guide

## Getting Started

### Finding Wild Pokemon
- **You start in Pallet Town at position (10, 10)** - There are NO wild Pokemon in towns!
- **To reach Route 1:**
  1. Go STRAIGHT UP (NORTH) from your starting position
  2. Keep going UP until you reach the VERY TOP of the town (y=0)
  3. The exit is between x=18 and x=22 at the top edge
  4. Step on the top edge to warp to Route 1
- **Once in Route 1, walk in TALL GRASS** (darker green tiles) to encounter Pokemon
- Encounter rate is about 12-20% per step in grass
- Your current position is shown in the top-left corner of the screen

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find any Pokemon!"
1. Make sure you're NOT in a town (Pallet Town, Viridian City, etc.)
2. Go to a ROUTE (Route 1 is north of Pallet Town)
3. Walk in TALL GRASS tiles
4. Keep walking - encounters are random (12-20% chance per step)
